# Flex Repeater +  [<img src="https://cdn.mussonindustrial.com/files/public/images/emblem.svg" alt="Musson Industrial Logo" width="90" height="40" align="right">][embr]

This module provides an enhanced Flex Repeater component.

## Enhancements

- Allows unique view paths for each instances.
- Allows for shared parameters/stylings that are passed to all instances.
- Performs load ahead optimization (the gateway starts the embedded views before the client requests them).
- Property passthrough (both in and out of the embedded views) is handled on the gateway, reducing latency.
