**(JavaScript Proxy)** `getJavaScriptProxy` no longer requires a `propertyName`.

Previously, `getJavaScriptProxy(propertyName)` allowed a component delegate to proxy multiple properties. However, since users couldn't interact with multiple proxy targets simultaneously, this design proved ineffectiveâ€”requiring multiple proxy objects for multiple properties.

Now, a component delegate may only return a single proxied object. This encourages bundling proxyable state into one object, improving usability for component consumers.

The `getJavaScriptProxy(propertyName)` overload is still supported, but the `propertyName` is ignored.
