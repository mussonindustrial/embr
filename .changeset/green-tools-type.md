Add `ApexCharts` component.

- This is a new implementation of the `ApexCharts` charting library as an Ignition component.
- Benefits over the `Legacy` component include:
  - Simplified rendering lifecycle (i.e. quicker to render/update)
  - JavaScript proxy support for direct chart interaction.
  - Improved designer property schema support.
  - Expanded selection of default component variants.
