Add ApexCharts (Legacy) component.

- This component is a one-for-one replacement of the ApexCharts component from the [Kyvis-Labs/ignition-apexcharts-module](https://github.com/Kyvis-Labs/ignition-apexcharts-module).
- This component matches the behavior, features, and property schema of the original Kyvis-Labs component.
- If both the Kyvis-Labs module and Embr-Charts are installed simultaneously, Embr-Charts will register and use the ApexCharts (Legacy) component in place of the Kyvis-Labs version, effectively overriding it to ensure compatibility and consistency.
